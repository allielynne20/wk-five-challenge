# Work Day Scheduler 

The purpose of this web page is to allow the user to create a daily schedule. The user will be able to see what the current date and time is at the top of the page. They will then be able click in any of the hour blocks to schedule a task and click the save button to save that task in the block. The tasks are saved in local storage so if the user decides to refresh the page the scheduled items will persist.
